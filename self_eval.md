# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
- It is useful anytime you want to check for something before returning a result. Especially when comparing 2 or more items.
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
I would not reread over everything so much. I worried about missing any inputs so took longer than needed.
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
I, for an unknown reason, really enjoy if/and/else statements. It's sort of like completing and maze or puzzle but with text.
